# face-detector
You don't have to try to recognize an actor in a film you're watching again. Face detector is an  app that accepts a movie title, outputs the movie poster, scrapes IMDB for the actors of the movie and trains a neural network to recognize the scraped images on the movie poster then gives you the name of the actors on the movie poster!
